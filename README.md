# Gold-Standard versus Ground Truth

Typical medicine diagonsis involves at least some known case/standard/criteria in achieving diagnostic results 
however
the true status (in particular, psychological/mental) of a patient can never be really revealed, isn't it?

Therefore, when a gold standard is missing, we need to rely on classifying the hidden/latent patterns of "repeatiable" large amount of individual oberservations to distinguish the bad's (cases) from the good's (ordinary).
